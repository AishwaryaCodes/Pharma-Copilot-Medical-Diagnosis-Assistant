🧩 Problem Statement:
Patients—especially those on multiple medications—are at risk of dangerous drug interactions, in-appropriate dosing, and un-noticed medical alerts. 
Most people lack the medical knowledge or time to manually research interactions or FDA warnings for their prescriptions.


Doctors and pharmacists do have tools, but there's a gap in user-friendly, AI-powered apps that:
1. Let users check interactions independently
2. Explain medical risks in simple terms
3. Suggest safer alternatives or doses
4. Provide AI-researched summaries


🧪 What This Project Does:
Pharma Copilot is a full-stack AI-powered tool that:

✅ Takes patient info (name, age, weight) and a list of medications

🚦 Analyzes potential risks like:

1. Drug-to-drug interactions

2. Dosage safety based on patient age/weight

3. Known black box warnings or alerts


🧠 Uses multiple AI agents to:

1. Scan for interactions

2. Suggest dosage adjustments

3. Explain medical risks in simple terms

4. Provide research-backed summaries


📄 Shows all results in a clean, downloadable report UI


🤖 AI Agents Working Behind the Scenes:
Each agent has a clear task:

DrugScanAgent: checks if a drug is risky or blacklisted

DoseAdjustAgent: recommends dose changes based on age/weight

AlertAgent: raises warnings about high-risk combinations

ExplainAgent: simplifies interactions in user-friendly language

ResearchAgent: pulls background insights from research papers

All of these are powered via Hugging Face LLMs and fallback to mocked responses if the API fails.



🛠️ Tech Stack Used:
Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS (clean UI for form/report)

Backend: FastAPI (handles analysis requests)

AI Layer: LangChain agents + HuggingFace inference

Database: Optional – could be used to store patient history (not implemented yet)
